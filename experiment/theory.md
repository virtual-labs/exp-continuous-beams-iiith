- Beams placed on more than 2 supports are called continuous beams. Continuous beams are used when the span of the beam is very large, deflection under each rigid support will be equal zero.

- BMD for Continuous beams

- BMD for continuous beams can be obtained by superimposing the fixed end moments diagram over the free bending moment diagram.

- Three - moment Equation for continuous beams THREE MOMENT EQUATION
