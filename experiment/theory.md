1. Beams placed on more than 2 supports are called continuous beams. Continuous beams are used when the span of the beam is very large, deflection under each rigid support will be equal zero.  
2. BMD for Continuous beams  
3. BMD for continuous beams can be obtained by superimposing the fixed end moments diagram over the free bending moment diagram.  
4. Three - moment Equation for continuous beams THREE MOMENT EQUATION
