Continuous beams, which are beams with more than two supports and covering more than one span, are not statically determinate using the static equilibrium laws

e = strain

&#963; = stress (N/m2)

E = Young's Modulus = &#963;/e (N/m2)

y = distance of surface from neutral surface (m).

R = Radius of neutral axis (m).

I = Moment of Inertia (m4 - more normally cm4)

Z = section modulus = I/y max(m3 - more normally cm3)

M = Moment (Nm)

w = Distributed load on beam (kg/m) or (N/m as force units)

W = total load on beam (kg ) or (N as force units)

F= Concentrated force on beam (N)

L = length of beam (m)

x = distance along beam (m)


#### Objective

To find the shear force diagram and bending moment diagram for a given continuous beam.
